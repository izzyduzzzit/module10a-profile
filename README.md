# Module 10A â€“ Profile Component with State and Props

## Description
This project demonstrates how to use React props and state to build an interactive profile component.

## What I Learned
- How to pass props to customize a component
- How to use useState for conditional rendering
- How to design interactive interfaces in React
- I had issues with dark mode and had to remove to get the assignment completed meeting the
  main requirements but that was one area I struggled with.
- I kept this assignment simple and focused on the main requirements to turn it in on time,
  but I am enjoying my time with React. This is what I wanted to learn how to do; make dynamic apps.
